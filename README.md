# README

Work through these activities to practice using javascript's built in string methods

## Instructions

- There are prompts for 19 different string methods. Many of them are self explanatory but you'll likely need to use the MDN documentation to learn how to use some of them.
- Log the required info for each prompt
- The easier version has descriptions of what methods you need to use
- the index.js version (normal difficulty) will require a bit of research (strongly recommended)
